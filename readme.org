* Advent Of Code - 2019
I'm trying to solve these problems as a practice for prolog programming.
** Day1
#+BEGIN_SRC prolog :exports both
  :- consult("src/day1.pl").
  :- main("inputs/day1", X), print(X).
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 4943969
** Day2
#+BEGIN_SRC prolog :exports both
  :- consult("src/day2.pl").
  %% Part1 1202 program
  :- output("inputs/day2", 12, 2, X), print(X), nl.
  %% Part2 finding input program
  :- find_inputs("inputs/day2", 19690720, N, V), Ans is N*100 + V, print(Ans), nl.
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| 3716293 |
|    6429 |
** Day3
Wasted a bit of time trying out a brute force solution. Finally tried out just intersecting lines of two wires rather than each point. A language with arrays would have lead to a more straight forward simulation. Prolog forced me to get more creative.
#+BEGIN_SRC prolog :exports both
  :- consult("src/day3.pl").
  :- main("inputs/day3", X, Y), writef('Part1: (%w), Part2: %t\n', [X, Y]).
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| Part1: (860 | 0) | Part2: 9238 |
